## What is Docker?

Docker is a container technology: a tool for creating and managing containers.

### **What is a Container in Software Development?**

Think of a **container** as a **self-contained unit** that has:

- Your code

- All the tools, libraries, and dependencies needed to run that code



 **Why is this useful?**  
Because when you run your code inside a container, it will always behave the **same way**, regardless of:

- The machine

- The OS

- The environment

That’s powerful — no more "It worked on my machine but not on the server" issues.

 **Example:**  
If you write a **Node.js** app, the container would include:

- Your Node.js code

- Node.js itself (runtime)

- Any needed libraries (like `express`, etc.)

The result? You give someone that container, and it works exactly as it did for you.



### Why Containers Matter:

- **Same behavior everywhere** – consistent execution

-  **Built-in OS support** – easy to run on modern OSs

-  **Simplifies software management** – via Docker
